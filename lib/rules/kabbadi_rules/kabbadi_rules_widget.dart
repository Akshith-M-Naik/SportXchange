It is played across the country and is the official game in the states of Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Telangana and Maharashtra. Outside of India it is a popular activity in Iran, is the national game of Bangladesh and is also one of the national sports of Nepal where it is taught in all state schools. Kabaddi is also popular in other parts of the world where there are Indian and Pakistani communities such as in the United Kingdom where the sport is governed by the England Kabaddi Federation UK.\n\nThere are many regional variations of the game of Kabaddi in India, including Sanjeevani, Gaminee, Punjabi and Amar versions, all of which have slightly different interpretations of the game and its rules. There are also other games very similar to Kabaddi in both India and other countries that may not be pure Kabaddi, they are very closely related. These include the game of Hadudu that is played in Bangladesh, the Maldives’ Baibalaa and Maharashtra’s Hututu.\n\nThe governing body for Kabaddi is the International Kabaddi Federation and consists of over 30 national associations and oversees the game and its rules across the world.',
